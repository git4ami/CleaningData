# Getting and Cleaning Data Cource project

## Overview

The repo was created for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data cource project.
The project is about reading data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphones, cleaning the data and producing a new tidy data set (saved into a .txt file)

## Contents

This repo contains 3 files:

- README.md  short descriprion of the repo and transformation
- CodeBook.md detailed description of the variables, algorithms, input and output of the transformations performed in the project 
- run_analysis.R R script performing the analysis


## Transformation performed

 * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
 * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
 * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
